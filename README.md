## Introduction


#### DAO
It is an acronym for Data Access Object, which generates some methods that help us to create the persistance model. 

#### Nested classes
Nested classes are used when business logic indicates that only the outer class will make use of them. these can be classified as:
- Inner classes, these can be: inner classes, method local inner classes and anonymous classes
- Static classes


#### JDBC 
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an API that provides classes in order to use a data base. Some of them are:
- Driver Manager creates an instance for a connector
- Connection creates a session that only is usefull during the connection to the database
- Statement brings data from the database
- PreparedStatement brings data from the databse, but it's possible to add some parameters into the request
- ResultSet manages data that is already obtained

#### Java docs
Javadoc is a tool that is used for generating Java code documentation, that documentation is in HTML format.
